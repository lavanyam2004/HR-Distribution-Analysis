Sentiment Analysis Machine Learning Project (University Module - IT1244 Project)       
•	Classified texts from tweets using Python into positive or negative sentiments using Machine Learning Algorithms imported from scikit-learn.  
•	Explored Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes Classifier and Random Forest Classifier. Achieved over 80% accuracy with Naive Bayes Classifier. 
•	Utilized pandas, numpy, and scikit-learn to carry out common Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks such as tokenization and vectorization on over 20,000 rows of data.
